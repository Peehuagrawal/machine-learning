## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?  

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is broadly classified into:  

1️⃣ **Supervised Learning** 🏷️ - Models are trained using labeled data (input-output pairs).  
2️⃣ **Unsupervised Learning** 🔍 - Models analyze patterns in **unlabeled** data without predefined outputs.
